In the Ruby programming ecosystem, automating Continuous Integration (CI) is a
fundamental practice to ensure code quality and streamline the development
process. Here are some key aspects to consider when setting up CI in the Ruby
ecosystem:

1. **Linting, Testing, and Building Tools**:

   - **Linting**: Ruby developers commonly use tools like RuboCop to enforce
     code style and maintainability standards. RuboCop checks for style guide
     violations and code consistency.
   - **Testing**: RSpec and Minitest are popular Ruby testing frameworks. For
     behavior-driven development, RSpec provides expressive testing
     capabilities. For unit and integration testing, Minitest offers a
     lightweight alternative.
   - **Building**: Building Ruby applications usually involves managing
     dependencies, compiling assets, and creating distribution packages.
     Bundler manages gem dependencies, and tools like Webpack or the asset
     pipeline in Ruby on Rails handle asset compilation.

2. **CI Tools Alternatives**:

   Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other popular CI/CD tools include Travis
   CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. Travis CI is known for its ease of use,
   CircleCI offers advanced customization, and GitLab CI/CD provides a
   comprehensive integrated solution.

3. **Self-Hosted vs. Cloud-Based**:

   The choice between self-hosted and cloud-based CI depends on the project's
   specific requirements and resources. To make the decision between
   self-hosted and cloud-based CI, consider factors like project size, resource
   availability, budget, security, and compliance needs. Small to mid-sized
   projects often find cloud-based CI solutions like GitHub Actions convenient,
   while larger projects may prefer the control of self-hosted environments.
   The choice ultimately hinges on finding the right balance between
   customization and ease of management for the specific project's
   requirements.
